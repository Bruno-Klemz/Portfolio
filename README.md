### Profile

🤙 Hi, my name is Bruno but feel free to call me Klemz. In general, I tend to define myself as a flexible person with a great emphasis on helping others around me, because I feel that together we can grow a lot.
  
🖥️ My focus is mobile development through the Flutter crossplatform framework, where I develop for both Android and iOS. In personal projects I worked with HTTP requests for REST API, consumption of third-party API's, state management and software architecture with BLoC Pattern, non-relational database construction in Firebase and much more.
  
I am currently looking to improve:
  - ✏️ UI/UX skills to develop apps closer to customer expectations
  - 🖥️ Dart/Flutter ecosystem skills adding test units, more state management pattern like Mobx or Provider, others database consuming and more skill that I'll need in my day's challenges.
  - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Working in multidisciplinary groups to develop even more my soft skills.

### Experience
  
>### 🩺 Freelance 
>#### FEB 2021 - OCT 2021 | Curitiba, Brazil
>Over the six months, I developed a simple appointment management app for a dental office. I learned how to implement BLoC and MVVM as state management and sofware architecture, respectively.

>### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Startup
>#### JAN 2021 - In work | BuffSpot
>As it is a two-member startup, I participated in the entire idea development process, from the ideation of the business, conversations with external stakeholders, code development to the company's marketing. During the process, I learned how to create and design an idea based on agile development concepts with a focus on MVP. Methodologies such as Scrum, Sprint and Kanban were used to organize the workflow
  
>### 🚙 Renault Brazil
>### OCT 2021 - In work | Ayrton Senna Complex, São José dos Pinhais, Brazil
>At Renault, I developed applications as a final part of projects focused on production line cars. Working individually, I learned to use BLoC as a design pattern in addition to state management, Firebase Auth API consumption, HTTP requests for database operations and also the prototyping and code development of the application screens.

### Skills
  
| **General Coding Skills** | **Dart/Flutter Skills** | **Complementary Skills** | **Soft Skills** |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Object Oriented Programming | BLoC State Management | Figma | Empathy 
| MVVM Architecture | JSON Parsing | Microsoft Teams | Critical Sense 
| BLoC Architecture | Anonymous function | Trello | Ease of learning
| Firebase Auth/Realtime Database/Storage | Collections | | Adaptation in different scenarios
| Consume APIs| Asynchronism | | Problem solving
| | REST API | | Good communication
| | | | Manage conflicts

### Education
>### Control and Automation Engineering
>#### FEB 2017 - JUL 2023 | PUCPR Curitiba, Brazil
>My focus in control and automation engineering has always been the scope of software development, here I mainly learned about some software engineering principles, imperative and object-oriented programming, data structure, SQL databases and distributed systems (besides of course a lot engineering calculation).

<br/>
Instagram clone is an app focused on my personal development in creating screens from a third-party prototype. In it, I used Columns and Rows to align vertically and horizontally, as well as ListView and GridView to arrange the information in Stories and Gallery format, as specified in the source prototype. To record the information, I used Firebase Storage as a database for this app, given its ease of working with images. Because of this, I consumed the Firebase Storage API focusing on GET in the url's of each image

  
Technologies and Tools used in this project:

  - 🖥️ Firebase Storage 
  - 📝 BLoC Pattern
  - 🗒️ Versioning in git
  - ↕️ Auto Layout (Columns and Rows)
  - 🖼️ Grid View/List View

### Resume
The project was requested by PagStar, a company focused on digital wallets. In this project, the main concept delivered was the calculation method for the amount of material needed for a civil plant. For the design, the concept was left open, keeping in mind the beauty of the final product. As requirements for the project were listed:
  - MobX as state management
  - Modular to dependency injection and route system
  - Handle exceptions
  - Great design
 
### Personal development
In this project, not having a pre-established design, made me develop myself in the screen prototype process, with great learning in UI/UX concepts such as:
  - 60-30-10 rule
  - Error messages for user feedback
  - Build a model from the brand's visual identity
     
In addition, I was able to put into practice the MobX concepts for state management, where the most relevant points were:
  - Observables variables, actions functions and observer builder
  - Auto generated codes
