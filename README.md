### About Me

Hi, my name is Bruno, but feel free to call me Klemz. I'm a flexible person, always focused on helping those around me because I truly believe we can grow much more together.

My main focus is mobile development using the cross-platform Flutter framework, building apps for both Android and iOS. I'm currently aiming to become a tech lead in the near future, so I'm constantly improving my skills, especially with the Dart + Flutter stack. I'm also learning Golang to deepen my understanding of the entire mobile app development lifecycle.

### Experience
  
>### 🧑‍💻 Flutter Developer at Indaband
>#### OCT 2022 - Present | Remote  
>Currently working at a startup developing an app for music lovers, with over **800k registered users**. The app allows remote collaboration to create music hits and build communities.  
>Daily responsibilities include:
>- Using **Clean Architecture**: From UI (Presenter) and BLoC (business logic) to Use Cases and Repository layers.
>- Using Hive to save infos locally on cache
>- Consuming **REST APIs** developed in Golang for chat and general operations.
>- Building complex UIs based on **Figma** designs.
>- Writing **unit tests** for all logic and UI layers.
>Also contributing ideas and improvements to the overall structure of the app.

>### 🧑‍💻 Flutter Developer at Smart Go WMS (Warehouse Management System)
>#### APR 2022 - OCT 2022 | On-site  
>- Developed mobile-first screens to manage stock, order picking, and warehouse transfers  
>- Translated manual logistics processes into efficient digital workflows  
>- Implemented Clean Architecture and BLoC for maintainable and testable code  
>- Integrated REST APIs for real-time inventory and order updates  
>- Used Hive for offline caching of warehouse data    
>- Participated in version control using Git 

>### 🚙 Renault Brazil
>### OCT 2021 - APR 2022 | Ayrton Senna Complex, São José dos Pinhais, Brazil
>At Renault, I developed applications as a final part of projects focused on production line cars. Working individually, I learned to use BLoC as a design pattern in addition to state management, Firebase Auth API consumption, HTTP requests for database operations and also the prototyping and code development of the application screens.

>### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Startup
>#### JAN 2021 - NOV 2022 | BuffSpot
>As it is a two-member startup, I participated in the entire idea development process, from the ideation of the business, conversations with external stakeholders, code development to the company's marketing. During the process, I learned how to create and design an idea based on agile development concepts with a focus on MVP. Methodologies such as Scrum, Sprint and Kanban were used to organize the workflow

#### Circles and Feed

- **Circles** is a feature focused on creating organic communities.  
- In the **Feed**, users can interact with other artists and apply two filters: **Shuffle** and **Hide viewed sessions**.  
- It also includes the **Quick Peek** feature, where the feed displays a 15-second preview centered in the middle of the video, allowing for faster content discovery.

</p>

#### Collections

- **Collections** is a feature that allows users to filter sessions (videos) through two main tabs: **Posts/Reposts** and **Playlists**.  
- In the **Posts/Reposts** tab, users can refine the view using sub-filters: **All**, **Posts**, and **Reposts**.  
- In the **Playlists** tab, it’s possible to manage and organize sessions by adding new ones to custom playlists.

</p>

#### Monetization

- This feature starts with a **bottom sheet** displaying the user's current balance along with **eight different transfer options**.
- If the user wishes to top up, there's a dedicated **Recharge** button.
- By tapping it, the user is redirected to a screen with multiple **recharge methods**, making it easy to add credits to their account.

  Thoughtfully designed interface using Flutter’s theming system with clean typography (`labelMedium`, `bodyLarge`, etc.), badges for equipment tags, and animated expandable tiles for each exercise.

- 🌐 **Wger API Integration**  
  Exercises, muscle groups, categories, and translations are all fetched from the Wger API with support for language selection.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Flutter + Dart

### Personal development
## 🌱 Personal Development

Working on the **Fit Track** project has significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth. Throughout the development process, I had the opportunity to deepen my expertise in Flutter and architectural patterns such as Clean Architecture and BLoC. This experience helped me structure scalable and maintainable code while also reinforcing good practices in modularization and state management.

Moreover, I improved my ability to integrate and consume external RESTful APIs, particularly through the dynamic use of the Wger API. This sharpened my skills in filtering, parsing, and handling asynchronous data, as well as managing localized content using translation support.

Lastly, the project enhanced my self-discipline and problem-solving skills, as I worked independently to build and refine all major features—from backend logic to frontend animations. It was a valuable journey of continuous learning, technical refinement, and creative exploration.
